# **MoodTunes: Your Emotions, Your Music**

### **The Idea**

I've always found that I can process my emotions better through music. Whether I am feeling good, bad, or need some energy, there's a song out there for it. I wanted to create a playful, interactive tool that converts your emotions into a customized playlist. That's the overall idea behind **MoodTunes**.

### **How I Built It**

I developed MoodTunes independently, but I did have an amazing coding buddy: an AI tool named Kiro.

- I began with a clean boilerplate using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
- The core of the project is the **Spotify Web API**, which allows me to fetch songs and build playlists.
- I employed a mood analysis tool to determine how to express an individual's emotions in terms of music such as energy, positivity, and tempo.
- **Clerk** manages user logins, and **Framer Motion** provides all the smooth animations.
- Kiro was a lifesaver. I utilized it to get the groundwork for the project established, and "vibe coded" after that, rapidly building on features such as the Spotify plugin and the animations.

### **What I Learned**

Through this project, I learned so much about integrating emotion analysis with musical data to produce insightful recommendations. I also learned how amazing it is to work with an AI teammate like Kiroâ€”it accelerated the development process so much and made it so much more collaborative than being solely in code. And naturally, I learned a great deal about working with the particular issues of the Spotify API, such as rate limits and using its various endpoints.

### **Biggest Challenges**

- **Translating emotions:** The most difficult aspect was determining how to convert a general text input such as "feeling a bit blue" into the appropriate musical parameters. It involved a lot of experimenting and trial and error.
- **Spotify API:** Ensuring the recommendations were always new and varied while working with API constraints was a continuous challenge. When one of the crucial recommendation endpoints was deprecated last year, I had to get creative and figure out a new way to get it to work.
- **Finishing touches:** I had limited time, so striking the balance between the core functionality and being polished and user-friendly was an actual balancing act.
- **Flying solo:** Handling the front and back end individually was a large task, but doing it with the support of Kiro made it significantly easier.

## How I Used Kiro

Building MoodTunes solo in 30 days wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without Kiro. Below are the main ways I used it during development.

### 1) Spec-to-Code Scaffolding

I wrote the initial feature spec in Kiro and used the generated starter to bootstrap the project. Kiro produced a clean Next.js project with Tailwind CSS, API routes, and an organized file structure ‚Äî saving hours of boilerplate work and letting me focus on features immediately.

### 2) Vibe Coding for Spotify Integration

I paired with Kiro to implement the Spotify Web API integration. Rather than switching constantly between docs and trial-and-error, I described desired behaviours (for example: ‚Äúrecommend tracks based on mood and avoid duplicates‚Äù) and Kiro returned working API call examples, retry logic, and query strategies.

### 3) Debugging & Refactoring

Kiro helped debug Clerk authentication issues and refine the mood analysis pipeline. It suggested clearer error handling and fallback flows for Spotify rate limits and API failures.

### 4) Workflow Boost

By offloading repetitive tasks ‚Äî scaffolding, structuring, and routine debugging ‚Äî to Kiro, I focused more on design and UX. Kiro acted as a reliable coding partner, enabling a polished, feature-rich app to be built solo and on schedule.

## üéµ How It Works

### 1. Express Your Mood

Type how you're feeling in natural language. Be as descriptive as you want:

- Search across multiple genres based on your detected mood
- Retrieve up to 10 songs per genre for variety
- Remove duplicates and shuffle for randomness

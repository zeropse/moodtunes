# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification focuses on comprehensive optimization of the existing mood-to-playlist generator application. The goal is to enhance performance, improve user experience, fix UI issues, and ensure robust error handling. The optimizations will address latency issues, implement lazy loading, improve responsiveness across all devices, add smooth animations, fix navbar jittering, implement proper authentication flows, and optimize the overall application architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and respond instantly to my interactions, so that I can have a seamless music discovery experience without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page THEN the initial page load SHALL complete within 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection
2. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the navigation SHALL complete within 500ms
3. WHEN a user submits a mood input THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback within 100ms
4. WHEN the system processes mood analysis THEN it SHALL complete within 3 seconds maximum
5. WHEN Spotify playlist generation occurs THEN it SHALL complete within 5 seconds maximum
6. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL be lazy loaded and optimized for the user's device
7. IF any operation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators with estimated completion time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all images and media to load efficiently without blocking the interface, so that I can interact with the application while content loads in the background.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page contains images THEN they SHALL be lazy loaded only when entering the viewport
2. WHEN images are loading THEN placeholder content SHALL be displayed to prevent layout shifts
3. WHEN images load THEN they SHALL use appropriate formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallbacks
4. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL be responsive and optimized for different screen sizes
5. WHEN the Spotify embed loads THEN it SHALL not block other page interactions
6. WHEN background animations render THEN they SHALL not impact image loading performance
7. IF an image fails to load THEN a graceful fallback SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work perfectly on any device size, so that I can use it seamlessly whether I'm on mobile, tablet, or desktop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile devices THEN all elements SHALL be properly sized and accessible
2. WHEN a user rotates their device THEN the layout SHALL adapt smoothly without content overflow
3. WHEN a user interacts with touch elements THEN they SHALL have appropriate touch targets (minimum 44px)
4. WHEN text is displayed THEN it SHALL be readable without horizontal scrolling on any device
5. WHEN forms are used THEN they SHALL be optimized for mobile input with appropriate keyboards
6. WHEN the navbar is displayed THEN it SHALL be fully functional and non-jittery on all screen sizes
7. WHEN animations play THEN they SHALL be optimized for mobile performance and battery life

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and delightful animations throughout the application, so that my interactions feel polished and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page transitions occur THEN they SHALL use smooth animations with appropriate easing
2. WHEN UI elements appear or disappear THEN they SHALL animate smoothly without jarring movements
3. WHEN the user hovers over interactive elements THEN they SHALL provide smooth visual feedback
4. WHEN background animations play THEN they SHALL maintain 60fps performance on modern devices
5. WHEN animations are active THEN they SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion
6. WHEN multiple animations occur simultaneously THEN they SHALL be coordinated and not conflict
7. IF the device has limited performance THEN animations SHALL gracefully degrade or disable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation bar to be stable and responsive, so that I can navigate the application without visual glitches or jittering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the navbar is displayed THEN it SHALL remain stable without jittering or layout shifts
2. WHEN the navbar resizes THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and controlled
3. WHEN the user scrolls THEN the navbar SHALL maintain its position and styling consistently
4. WHEN the viewport changes size THEN the navbar SHALL adapt without visual glitches
5. WHEN navigation items are clicked THEN they SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
6. WHEN the navbar collapses on mobile THEN the animation SHALL be smooth and predictable
7. IF the navbar contains dynamic content THEN it SHALL not cause layout instability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who is not signed in, I want clear feedback when I try to access features that require authentication, so that I understand what I need to do and can easily sign in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a non-authenticated user tries to generate a playlist THEN the system SHALL display a clear toast message explaining authentication is required
2. WHEN the authentication toast appears THEN it SHALL include a direct link or button to sign in
3. WHEN a user clicks the sign-in link from a toast THEN they SHALL be redirected to the sign-in page with a return URL
4. WHEN a user successfully signs in THEN they SHALL be redirected back to their original action
5. WHEN authentication is required THEN the UI SHALL clearly indicate which features need sign-in
6. WHEN a user is signed in THEN all previously restricted features SHALL become available
7. IF sign-in fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed with retry options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage to prevent failures and regressions, so that the application remains stable and reliable for users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN automated tests SHALL verify functionality remains intact
2. WHEN components are rendered THEN unit tests SHALL verify they display correctly with various props
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN integration tests SHALL verify correct responses and error handling
4. WHEN user interactions occur THEN end-to-end tests SHALL verify complete workflows function properly
5. WHEN performance optimizations are implemented THEN tests SHALL verify they don't break existing functionality
6. WHEN errors occur THEN tests SHALL verify appropriate error handling and user feedback
7. WHEN the application is deployed THEN all tests SHALL pass before release

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and provide helpful feedback, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly messages with retry options
2. WHEN API services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback functionality where possible
3. WHEN unexpected errors happen THEN the system SHALL log details for debugging while showing generic user messages
4. WHEN form validation fails THEN clear, specific error messages SHALL be displayed near the relevant fields
5. WHEN authentication expires THEN the user SHALL be prompted to re-authenticate with context preservation
6. WHEN external services fail THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully without breaking the entire application
7. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide contact information or support options

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be optimized for search engines and social sharing, so that it loads quickly and displays properly when shared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN they SHALL have appropriate meta tags for SEO and social sharing
2. WHEN the application is shared on social media THEN it SHALL display proper previews with images and descriptions
3. WHEN search engines crawl the site THEN they SHALL find properly structured content and metadata
4. WHEN pages are accessed THEN they SHALL have semantic HTML structure for accessibility and SEO
5. WHEN images are used for social sharing THEN they SHALL be optimized and properly sized
6. WHEN the application loads THEN critical rendering path SHALL be optimized for fast initial paint
7. IF JavaScript is disabled THEN basic content SHALL still be accessible and readable
